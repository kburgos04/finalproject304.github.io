                Biometric data can be a very efficent tool when it comes to better security, but it's comes with serious ethical problems. It includes aspects such as fingerprints, face scans, and even your posture or your voice. You can't change your fingerprint or your face like a password. Biometrics is your DNA and physical structure, it cannot be changed. Once your biometric data is stolen or compromised, it's gone for good. That's what makes it so risky.

            <p>
                One of the biggest concerns is privacy. Most people aren’t even aware their biometric information is being collected or where it’s being stored. Governments and companies sometimes take the information without fully explaining to people what they're going to use it for. And once they have it, there isn't always a clear way to get it back.
            </p>
            <p>
                And then there is the issue of consent. One clicking "I agree" does not necessarily mean they truly understand the risks. The biometric systems are often embedded in telephones, cameras, and buildings, and people just give consent without truly reading the whole terms and conditions. And it does not mean that they agree with what eventually occurs to that data if it is stolen or sold.
            </p>
            <p>
                There's also a tremendous problem with bias. Some of the biometric technologies do not work as well on people who have darker skin, older people, or people with disabilities. That can lead to unequal treatment or being left out altogether. It might not identify a person just because of the way they look or sound, and it is not fair at all.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally there's the question of surveillance. When biometrics are being used in public spaces, facial recognition cameras are being used sporadically while you're just walking down the street and you're pretty much in a situation where you're constantly being watched and identified. This kind of system can be abused by authorities, and it can leave regular citizens feeling like they have absolutely no privacy.
            </p>
            <p>
                So while biometric data certainly does simplify life in some ways, there is also an enormous number of threats that cannot be ignored. These threats are significant because they affect real people, and there is no reversal once this information is compromised.
