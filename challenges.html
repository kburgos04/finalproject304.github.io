  <p>Ethical and Social Issues with Biometric Technology</p>

  <h2>3. Complexities and Social Challenges</h2>

  <h3>Biometric Permanence & Risk</h3>
  <p>Biometric data can be a very efficient tool when it comes to better security but it has many serious ethical problems. There are many biometric technologies like fingerprints, face scans, and even your posture or your voice. You can't change your fingerprint or your face like a password. Biometrics is your DNA and physical structure, it cannot be changed. Once your biometric data is stolen or compromised, it's gone for good. That's what makes it so risky.</p>

  <h3>Privacy Concerns</h3>
  <p>One of the biggest concerns is privacy. Most people aren't even aware their biometric information is being collected or where it's being stored. Governments and companies sometimes take the information without fully explaining to people what they're going to use it for. And once they have it, there isn't always a clear way to get it back.</p>

  <h3>Consent and Awareness</h3>
  <p>Then there's the issue of consent. One clicking "I agree" does not necessarily mean they truly understand the risks. The biometric systems are often embedded in telephones, cameras, and buildings, and people just give consent without truly reading the whole terms and conditions. And it does not mean that they agree with what eventually occurs to that data if it is stolen or sold.</p>

  <h3>Bias and Discrimination</h3>
  <p>There's also a tremendous problem with bias. Some of the biometric technologies do not work as well with people who have darker skin tones, older people, or people with disabilities. That can lead to unequal treatment or being left out altogether. It might not identify a person just because of the way they look or sound, and it is not fair at all.</p>

  <h3>Public Surveillance</h3>
  <p>Finally there's the question of surveillance. When biometrics are being used in public spaces, facial recognition cameras are being used sporadically while you're just walking down the street and you're pretty much in a situation where you're constantly being watched and identified. This kind of system can be abused by authorities, and it can leave regular citizens feeling like they have absolutely no privacy.</p>

  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
  <p>So while biometric data certainly does simplify life in some ways, there is also an enormous number of threats that cannot be ignored. These threats are significant because they affect real people, and there is no reversal once this information is compromised.</p>
